# Telos - *The Highly customisable Bullet Journal Web App*

## Abstract
Bullet journals are the blank canvas to organise your life! Record your thoughts, ideas and goals.

- The advantage of the paper bullet journal is how flexible it is.
- The advantage of the online bullet journal is the tracking and notifications.

On the left-hand-side, there is a habit tracker where you fill in a square each time you do that habit.

In the middle, there are some normal bullets for days of the week.

On the right-hand-side, there is an Emacs org-mode with bullets, checklists, priorities and text-folding. Of course this is not the only digital bullet-journal option, there are a couple others: Notion, Memento, Kanban boards like Trello etc.
